_CS420 Machine Learning Course Project_

## Dataset

Dataset from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It seemed that millions of people have
already spent billions of dollars doing trillions of research on it. 

~~Improvement of performance seems ridiculously far out of reach.~~

## Preprocessing

### Read

Read data and do the cache... Done.

## Plans

+ Do the deep learning?
+ Use SVM or similar?
+ ~~Fill the report with trash.~~

## Scratch

Please ignore this part.
